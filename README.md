PyGame Spaceship Demo

This is a fun spaceship demo that mimics the physics in asteroids.  Run with:

>>> python test_drawship.py

Spaceship controls:
Up arrow: thrust
Left/right arrows: turn
Spacebar: Shoot bullets
Reverse direction by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction.

Dependencies are Pygame, NumPy (numpy.scipy.org), and Will McGugan's Game Objects library (http://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/search/?s=game+objects).
